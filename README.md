# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Decision Trees

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival in the Titanic disaster using the Decision Tree algorithm. It explores data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretability through visualization techniques like learning curves and feature importance.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and other attributes.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize:
  - Learning Curves (to assess underfitting/overfitting)
  - Feature Importance (to interpret model decisions)
  - Decision Tree structure
  - SHAP values (optional for deeper model interpretation)
